        <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>

        <p class="synopsis">CSS selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements in a HTML document. This is
            <strong>super</strong> useful.</p>

        <p>Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select arbitrary boxes in your web pages.</p>

        <p>We'll also be talking about links in this example, so here's <a
                href="https://internetingishard.netlify.app">Interneting Is Hard</a> for us to style.</p>

        <a class="button">Button One</a>
        <a id="button-2" class="button call-to-action">Button Two</a>
        <!-- When we changed the <div> element to the <a> element, we lost some of our styles even though we’re using the same classes. This is because <a> is an inline element by default and also has a default color value. -->

    </div>
    <div class="sidebar">
        <p>If this page had a sidebar...</p>
        <p>We'd have some problems with pseudo-classes.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- From the same page -->
<a href='#button-2'>Go to Button Two</a>

<!-- From a different page -->
<a href='selectors.html#button-2'>Go to Button Two</a>
